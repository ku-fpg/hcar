The Haskell Equational Reasoning Model-to-Implementation Tunnel
(HERMIT) is an NSF-funded project being run at KU \cref{ukansas}, which aims to improve the
applicability of Haskell-hosted Semi-Formal Models to High Assurance Development.
Specifically, HERMIT uses a Haskell-hosted DSL
and a refinement DSL to perform rewrites directly on Haskell Core,
the GHC internal representation.

Over the summer, we reworked our user-level refinement DSL to use Haskell,
by making use of the remote monad~\cref{RemoteMonad}. This new
shell, dubbed the Black Shell, replaced the REPL with GHCi,
and brings the full power of Haskell DSLs to new API. The
port has been complete, and we hope to release HERMIT, with the Black Shell, shortly.
