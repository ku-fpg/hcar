ChalkBoard is a domain specific language for describing images. 
The language is uncompromisingly functional
and encourages the use of modern functional idioms.
The novel contribution of ChalkBoard is that it uses off-the-shelf
graphics cards to speed up rendering of our functional description.
We always intended to use ChalkBoard to animate educational
videos, as well as for processing streaming videos.
Since the last HCAR report, we have added a new animation language, based round a new applicative
functor, \verb|Active|. It has been called Functional Reactive Programming,
without the reactive part! The paper
``Every Animation Should Have a Beginning, a Middle, and an End'' talks
about this addition. 

A release was scheduled for November 2010.
