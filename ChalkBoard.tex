ChalkBoard is a domain specific language for describing images. 
The language is uncompromisingly functional
and encourages the use of modern functional idioms.
The novel contribution of ChalkBoard is that it uses off-the-shelf
graphics cards to speed up rendering of our functional description.
We always intended to use ChalkBoard to animate educational
videos, as well as for processing streaming videos.
ChalkBoard also has an animation language,
based round an applicative functor, \verb|Active|.
It has been called Functional Reactive Programming,
without the reactive part! 

ChalkBoard has been released on hackage,
but is not actively being developed.
It would be nice to port the code to HTML5,
and are happy to act as mentors for this effort.

Kevin Matlage graduated in May 2011 with an MS. His MS thesis was about the
design, implementation and applications of ChalkBoard. The thesis was awarded
the departmental Miller award, for best MS of the year.
Congratulations Kevin!
