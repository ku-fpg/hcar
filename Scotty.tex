Scotty is a Haskell web framework inspired by Ruby's Sinatra, using WAI \cref{wai} and Warp \cref{warp},
and is designed to be a cheap and cheerful way to write RESTful, declarative web applications.

\begin{itemize}
\item A page is as simple as defining the verb, url pattern, and Text content.
\item It is template-language agnostic. Anything that returns a Text value will do.
\item Conforms to WAI Application interface.
\item Uses very fast Warp webserver by default.
\end{itemize}

The goal of Scotty is to enable the development of simple HTTP/JSON interfaces
to Haskell applications. Implemented as a monad transformer stack, Scotty applications
can be embedded in arbitrary MonadIOs. The Scotty API is minimal, and fully documented via haddock.
The API has recently remained stable, with a steady stream of improvements contributed
by the community.
