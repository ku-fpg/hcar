At KU, we are interested in providing better support in Haskell for
interactive applications by building on top of existing web technologies,
like the fast Chrome browser, HTML5, and JavaScript. This is motivated
partly by having easy tools to teach interactive programming Haskell,
and partly by the needs of the HERMIT project.
