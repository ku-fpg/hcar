Functional Programming continues at KU and
the Computer Systems Design Laboratory in ITTC!
The System Level Design Group (lead by Perry Alexander)
and the Functional Programming Group (lead by Andy Gill)
together form the core functional programming initiative at KU.
There are three major Haskell projects at KU (as
well as numerous smaller ones):
the GHC rewrite plugin HERMIT~\cref{HERMIT},
the VHDL generator Kansas Lava~\cref{klava} and
the JavaScript generator Sunroof~\cref{sunroof}.

Nicolas Frisby, who defended his PhD from KU last summer,
spend the spring at MSR Cambridge, working on optimizations
inside the Glasgow Haskell compiler.
Andrew Farmer spend the spring in Portland, OR, working
with functional programmers at Portland State.
