Functional Programming continues at KU and the Computer Systems Design
Laboratory in ITTC!  The System Level Design Group (lead by Perry Alexander)
and the Functional Programming Group (lead by Andrew Gill) together form the
core functional programming initiative at KU.  There are three major Haskell
projects at KU (as well as numerous smaller ones): the GHC rewrite plugin
HERMIT~\cref{HERMIT}, the Wakarusa Project~\cref{Wakarusa}, and the Haskino
Project~\cref{Haskino}.  All three projects are using now using the remote
monad design pattern~\cref{RemoteMonad} as a key technology.
